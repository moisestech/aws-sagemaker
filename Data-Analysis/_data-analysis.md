# Data Analysis

Data **preparation** and **preprocessing** includes the following:
• Data collection and integration in order to ensure your raw data is in one central, accessible place.
• Data preprocessing and data visualization which involves transforming raw data into an understandable format and extracting important features from the data.

- A common strategy is to split all available labeled data into training, validation, and testing subsets, usually with a ratio of 80%:10%:10%. (Another common ratio is 70%:15%:15%.)
