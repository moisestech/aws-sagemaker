# Problem Formulation

## The fundamental goal of ML is to *generalize* beyond the data instances used to train models. You want to evaluate your model to estimate the quality of its predictions for data the model has not been trained on

## Skills out of this course

- I can select and justify the appropriate ML approach to a problem.
- Build, train, evaluate, deploy, and fine-tune an ML model.
- Apply the steps of the ML pipeline to solve the problem. Describe best practices to create a solid ML pipeline in AWS.
- Identify the steps to apply ML to real business problems.

## **Common ML use cases**

1. Flight delays
2. Recommendation engine
3. Fraud detection

## ML Pipeline

1. Business Problem
   - Start with the business problem you or your team believe could benefit from machine learning.
2. Problem Formulation
   - From there, you want to do some problem formulation. This phase entails, in part, articulating your business problem and converting it to an ML problem.

## Types of Business Problems

• Categorization • Predictive routing • Fraud detection • Personalized Advertising • Voice assistants • Face unlock • Dynamic pricing • Email filtering • Self-driving cars
