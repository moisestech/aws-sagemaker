## **1.** Business Problem

- You have to start with a business problem that might be able to be addressed by ML.

## **2.** Problem Formulation

- Problem formulation is where you convert the business problem into a machine learning problem.

## **3.** Data collection and integration

- After you have your machine learning problem, you need data. Data collection and integration is where you collect and ingest the data from its original sources.

## **4.** Data Preprocessing and visualization

- After you’ve collected and integrated your data, data preprocessing includes preparation where you clean and prepare the data for the next step. Additionally, visualization/analysis is where you look through the data to try to identify patterns.

## **5.** Model training

- Model training and tuning is next, and that’s where your algorithm learns from the patterns in the data.

## **6.** Model evaluation

- After you’ve trained your model you need to evaluate how it performs. Model evaluation is where you evaluate how well the model performed based on identified metrics.

## **7.** Model tuning and feature engineering

- After seen how your model does, you’ll want to improve it. Feature engineering is the process of selecting and improving features. Feature selection is where you identify which characteristics of the data are likely to be useful for making predictions.

- Feature augmentation is how you iteratively improve the performance of your model by changing your features.

## **8.** Model deployment

- Model deployment is when you put your model into production.
