# Feature Engineering

## *Feature engineering* is the science ( and art) of extracting more information from existing data in order to improve your model's prediction power and hep your model learn faster.

- You are not adding any new data during featuring engineering, but, rather, you are making the data you already have more useful.

- This process often relies on domain knowledge of the data to engineer more effective features.
