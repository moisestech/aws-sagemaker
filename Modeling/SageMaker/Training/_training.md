# Training

## The goal of *[Model Training](https://evantage.gilmoreglobal.com/#/books/200-MLDWTS-11-EN-SG-E/cfi/255!/4/2@100:0.00)* is to create an accurate model that answers the business question correctly as often as you need it to or more

- We need to us engineered data to create an accurate model that is capable of answering the business problem correct MOST of the time.
- To get this kind of model, we need to select the appropriate algorithm.

- Algorithms
- Formatting data
- Splitting data and cross-validation
- Testing and validation techniques
- Examples of testing and validation techniques
- Model training concepts
- Running training jobs
- Demo 3: Create an Amazon SageMaker Training Job
