# Tuning NNs

- After running a training job, we evaluated our model and began a process of iterative tweaks to the model and our data. For instance, we performed **hyper-parameter optimization**. We tweaked the learning parameters to control how fast or slow our model was learning.
  - Learning too fast means that the algorithm will never reach an optimum value, while learning too slow means that the algorithm takes too long and may never converge to the optimum in the given number of steps.
