# Types of NNs

- The deep learning models in use today rely on things called **artificial neurons**.
- These are math functions that receive inputs and sum them up to create an output.
- In an **ANN**, each layer summarizes and feeds information to the next layer, ultimately producing a final output or prediction. During this process, the model derives the features itself.
