# Deep Learning

- **Deep learning** are algorithms that learn by using artificial neural networks (**ANN**).
  - Can be trained on raw features.
  - Include
    - A subset of ML methods
    - Neurons arranged for computational efficiency
    - Training networks with hundreds of layers that learn and improve the features.

- **Features**: are the parts of your datasets that are identified as important in determining accurate outcomes.
- **Weights**: represent how important an associated feature is to determining the accuracy of the outcome.

- While the theory for deep learning goes back decades, the hardware required to run deep learning problems wasn't generally accessible until very recently.

- In **deep learning**, the feature are derived by the **ANN** itself during the training and tuning process. THe performance of the model based on that training is then fed back in through the ANN iteratively until generating the final model.
