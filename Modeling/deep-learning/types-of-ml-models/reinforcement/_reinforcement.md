# Reinforcement

## **Reinforcement learning** is where the model interacts with its environment and learns to take actions that will maximize rewards

- The model continuously improves by mining feedback from previous iterations.
- In reinforcement learning, an agent continuously learns, through trial and error, as it interacts in an environment.
- Reinforcement learning is broadly useful when the reward of a desired outcome is known but the path to achieving it isn’t – and that path requires a lot of trial and error to discover.

## **Process**

1. In reinforcement learning, the thing driving the learning is called the **agent**.
2. The **environment** is where the **agent** learns.
3. When the **agent** does something in the **environment** that provokes a **response**, that is called an **action**.
4. The **response** is called a **reward** or **penalty** depending on whether the agent did something to be **reinforced** or **discouraged** in the model.
5. As the **agent** moves within the **environment**, its actions should start receiving more and more **rewards** and fewer and fewer **penalties**, unit it meets the **desired business outcome**.
