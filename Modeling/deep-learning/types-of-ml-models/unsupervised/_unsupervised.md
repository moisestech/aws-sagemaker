# Unsupervised

## **Unsupervised*learning** is where the model doesn't know inputs our outputs so it finds patterns in the data without help

- The machine has to uncover and create the labels itself.
- In **unsupervised learning** labels are not provided and the machine has to create the labels itself.
- These models use the data they're presented with to detect emerging properties of the entire dataset, and then construct patterns.
