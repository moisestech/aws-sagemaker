# Clustering

## **Clustering** groups data into different clusters based on similar features, in order to better understand the attributes to a specific cluster

- The advantage of unsupervised algorithms is they enable seeing patterns in the data that you were otherwise unaware of.
- One use case for unsupervised learning is anomaly detection.
- With unsupervised learning, models can identify what are simple outliers and what is more likely to be the cluster results.
